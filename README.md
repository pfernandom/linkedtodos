# LikedTODOS
A sample TODO application using Rest.li, Play Framework and Emberjs

## Requirements
Since the Play application uses the JARs generated by the Rest.li project, a local Maven repository (the m2 repo created in a standard Maven installation) is required.

## Build
To build the project, run the following Bash script:

    ./build.sh
    
## Deploy to Docker

In order to start the application using Docker Compose, run the following command:

    docker-compose up -d --build
    
Once Docker finishes building the images and creating the containers, navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the application's UI.
